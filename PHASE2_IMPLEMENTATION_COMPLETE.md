- Background task coordination
- Resource-aware migration scheduling
- Performance optimization for large collections

## üöÄ Migration Capabilities

### Supported Migration Paths
- **384-dim ‚Üí 768-dim**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ‚Üí `all-mpnet-base-v2`
- **Extensible**: Framework supports any embedding model migration

### Migration States
1. **INACTIVE** - No migration active
2. **PREPARATION** - Validating prerequisites and creating secondary collection
3. **SHADOW_MODE** - Dual collection operation with primary authoritative
4. **CANARY_TESTING** - Quality validation with small subset
5. **GRADUAL_MIGRATION** - Batch-by-batch memory migration
6. **FULL_MIGRATION** - Complete migration with secondary as primary
7. **CLEANUP** - Removing old collection and finalizing
8. **COMPLETED** - Migration successfully finished

### Quality Assurance
- **Automatic Quality Gates**: Monitor search performance degradation
- **Rollback Triggers**: Automatic rollback on quality threshold breach
- **Manual Controls**: Pause, resume, and rollback capabilities
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and metrics
